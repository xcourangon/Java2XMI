Java 2 XMI Mapping
------------------
XMI is a widely used interchange format for sharing models using XML. XMI defines many of the important aspects 
involved in describing objects in XML: 
* The representation of objects in terms of XML elements and attributes is the foundation. 
* Since objects are typically interconnected, XMI includes standard mechanisms to link objects within the same file or 
across files. 
* Object identity allows objects to be referenced from other objects in terms of IDs and UUIDs.
* Validation of XMI documents using XML Schemas.

XMI describes solutions to the above issues by specifying EBNF production rules to create XML documents and Schemas 
that share objects consistently.
